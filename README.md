# Hard-work-and-dedication
This is my heart and soul in an app I am putting together all my current knowledge of html, css, node, express, and javascript to bring my dream into reality please look at my thoughts.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, Express, and OAuth
In this app I am flexing my technological muscles and show all that I currently know how to. I am using a variety of packages and methods to make a user be able to place in an order and have an administrator be able to check it off as completed by a person.

## Optimizations
I need to make the admin features more fluent and clean up the appearance a bit but first things first make the app work then see if I can optimize it to work with less code then make it look nice.

## Lessons Learned:
I'm learning more about authorizations and I am linking multiple databases to one app and separating functions accessible from the two different authorizations.

## Examples:
Please take a moment to look at other recent projects that I have in my own portfolio:
